# Online Job Portal Project
Online Job Portal project is web application built using PHP, MySql as backend and HTML JavaScript &amp; Bootstrap as Frontend. 

<h3>Web Learners Project!</h3>

Weâ€™ve crafted this software as a mini project for academic requirement in Computer Science and Engineering.

    This is not a production ready software.
    We have uploaded and maintained this project for similar academic needs and to help beginners in Php.
    The Php programs are written using basic concepts, that anyone can understand.
    We haven't used any Php framework (such as code ignitor) or OOP concepts.
