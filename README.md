 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 
Our project titled “Job Portal” is a online web application through which an Job seeker can find their desired job. 
This web based system have many stakeholders including administrator, job seekers and companies.
It helps the user to access information about vacancies available from any location, thus saving time and money 
for visiting job consultancies. In this system the job seeker should register in the application using their name, 
address, contact number and email, educational qualifications, additional skills acquired, previous working 
experience then only he/she become part of this application. Email id becomes the username and the user can set
a password to login into a session to upload resume, search and apply for jobs. The job seeker are presented 
with a web based interface. All the users are able to see the general contents of the software system. 
The company (Job Provider) can register in the site as a job provider using company details like company name, 
address, representative name, contact phone/mail etc. Later on after login he can post jobs, refresh jobs, 
update jobs, remove a job, manage job applicants and shortlist the applicants using an optional online test. 
Our proposed system is developed using PHP with MySQL as backend and HTML, Bootstrap, AJAX, JavaScript 
technologies as front end. The system is web based so that the user can easily login to it, only requirement
